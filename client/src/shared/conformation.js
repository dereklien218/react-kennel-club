    descritionTwo:
      "First things first; the official term for dog shows is Conformation, as in, the act of conforming to the breed standard. While a dog show may look like a beauty pageant, it's not. Each AKC recognized breed has a parent club that writes and submits an official breed standard. The breed standard is the official blue print the spells out exactly how your favorite breed should look, move, and act so they can successfully do the job they were bred to do, and give us predictability in temperament.  Dogs are not being compared to each other, they're being compared to their individual breed standards. The purpose of Conformation is to evaluate breeding stock; this is the reason why spayed, neutered, and mixed breed dogs are not eligible to compete.  The goal of Conformation is the preservation of historic breeds and to produce the next generation of our favorite breeds, improved from the preceding generation.",
