        descriptionTwo: "Experienced dog owners can tell you that early training is one of the best ways to socialize your puppy during this important time of adjustment and development. Training can typically start as soon as soon as your puppy has completed the first round of vaccines (with the approval of your veterinarian), which can be as early as eight weeks.",
        descriptionThree: "AKC S.T.A.R. Puppy (Socialization, Training, Activity, and Responsibility) is the perfect place to start. AKC S.T.A.R. Puppy training classes teach the foundation for basic skills such as sit, down and come and provide the opportunity to socialize with other puppies and people. Positive reinforcement approach is used to teach young puppies the basics. When puppies are older, or near the end of a 6-weeks class, they will be able to perform S.T.A.R. behaviors more independently. At the end of the six-week class, your trainer will test you and your puppy on these basic skills to see how much you both have learned. Before you know it, you’ll be receiving your puppy’s AKC S.T.A.R. Puppy certificate and beautiful gold medal.  You and your puppy will be listed in the AKC S.T.A.R. Puppy records.",
